    <h1>Lunaris Hacks :)</h1>
    <p>Lunaris Hacks combines the best parts of case competitions and traditional hackathons into one. It's not just about building cool projects — it's about pitching your ideas, defending them, and showing off both your technical skills and creative thinking. At Lunaris, we see engineers as more than just coders — they're problem-solvers, designers, and future innovators. We're building an event where creativity meets real-world impact, and where anyone passionate about engineering can bring their ideas to life.</p>
